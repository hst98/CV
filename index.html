                DETECTION OF MALARIA PARASITES USING IMAGE PROCESSING
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Digital Image processing is widely used in the field of medicine and health monitoring. 
                        With computer hardware becoming more and more powerful, it is now possible to train 
                        models of convolutional neural network to analyse images. The basic idea is to use a 
                        sample blood output obtained from the patient to detect whether or not malarial parasite 
                        is present. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The aim of the project is to detect the presence of malaria parasite in the blood sample 
                        using the process of digital image processing. 1) To increase the accuracy of the detection 
                        of presence of the malaria parasite 2) To reduce the general time required to for the 
                        detection of malaria parasite as much as possible
